				As I said before I'm an aspiring web developer who is also a social activist seeking to help those less for fortunate as me because just because I seek to improve myself that doesn't mean I don't have to uplift others. Apart from these activities I also enjoy playing Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 and helping a dew new players every three months guiding them on how to play and succeed in the game and protect them against trolls and other toxic people as well advise them on what they should use their in game money on to further their financial empire. I also enjoy reading on geopolitics particularly in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.
